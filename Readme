PROGRESS-I

Created a base for the falling blocks. The base defines the playable game volume.
Modelled 5 different type of blocks in Blender.
Created an .obj parser to parse the model files into OpenGL standards.
Wrote the library for displaying the parsed object models onto the viewport.
Have used basic materials ( only the diffuse, specular, ambient and illumination parameters, no textures or shadows yet) to render the objects.
Implemented a restrictedly navigable camera with rotation bound to translation bound together for a nice cinematic zoom effect.
Currently placed blocks into the game volume randomly.
Implemented basic block selection and movement (albeit without any animation).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROGRESS-II

Implemented falling animation for blocks.
Added the background music and button triggered sounds.
Implemented partial game logic.
Allow players to save screenshots.
Loading a character, that is, an object which is not part of the world. 
A navigable camera.

Instructions for compilation 

1.	Install OpenGl and OpenAl -
	OpenGL: sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
	OpenAL: sudo apt-get install libopenal0a libopenal-dev
	ALUT:   sudo apt-get install libalut0 libalut-dev

2.	Makefile in Project folder contains the compilation commnads. So , just make and your executable will be ready.

Guidelines for the Game

 Player starts out with an empty game volume.
 Bricks falls at fixed intervals. Every next block is chosen randomly from the set of available blocks.
 A brick freezes in its position and orientation once it touches the base of the game volume.
 Player can rotate the bricks along all 3 axes. All possible space orientations of the block are achievable using these combination of rotations.
 A horizontal level is cleared if it contains no holes.
 A player loses if the top of any block touches the ceiling of the game volume.
 The fall speed of the blocks increases with time.

Basic Object Rendering:

Game Board
The game board is rendered using basic rasterization techniques.
Blocks / Shapes
• All the blocks are rendered from their respective object files.
• The objects are designed in Blender.
• Wrote a .obj file parser, that supports multiple object rendering.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geometric Transformations

Game Board
• Board rotation is devised using viewport settings.
• Every time user wants to rotate the board, camera direction is changed.

Blocks / Shapes
• Block rotations were enabled using Transformation Techniques.
• Translation to the block's center, rotation along one axis, then translating it back to its original coordinates using Homogeneous Coordinate Matrix.
• Changed coordinates were rendered every time on the respective key presses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Colors and Lightings

Lighting
• Lighting in the game is done using Blinn-Phong Model.
• Light source is kept very far from the board to ensure uniform illumination.

Coloring
• Coloring of blocks is done using glMaterialfv() .
• There are two lights in the frame, and they have all the three components, i.e. diffused, specular & ambient.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Textures
Game Board
• 2D texture mapping is registered on the game board.

Sky-Dome
• Sky-Dome implementation with a texture map on its inner surface gives a unique look to the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some More Cool Features

• Screenshot can be taken at any point in the game, to give a chance to the user to brag about his expertise later.
• Background score is implemented, a pleasant music makes our life so easy & enjoyable.
• Multiple Viewports are implemented, one having the main game frame, other having a HUD for the game.
• Navigable Camera is implemented using mouse drags to ensure a better user experience.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scoring System
• Whenever a block touches the base board and freezes, 5 points are added to the user score.
• Whenever a complete coat is found and deleted, 100 points are added to the user score.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ester-Eggs

If a block strikes lower left corner of the game frame, the surrounding ambience changes.
